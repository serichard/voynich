# Voynich

The Voynich Manuscript is an illustrated manuscript code that has not yet been defined the structure of the writing and the relationship to other languages. This study investigated the effectiveness of examining point detail versus examining the full picture all at once in a single study. In the approach of this study, one of these ways, some letter patterns based on frequency and word length were identified, including connections at different combinations of consonant and vowel letters by a statistical approach for a hidden Markov model. A narrowly directed systematic direction can help lead to the unraveling of the manuscript text in progressive steps.
